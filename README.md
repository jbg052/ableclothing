# ABLE Clothing: Ethical Fashion That Empowers Women, Premium Quality Meets Purpose

You know that feeling when you find a brand that just *gets* it? Where you don't have to choose between looking good and doing good? That's ABLE for you.

I stumbled across ABLE a while back when I was hunting for a decent denim jacket. Not just any jacket—one that wouldn't fall apart after three washes and didn't make me feel guilty about how it was made. What I discovered was way more than just great clothes.


## What Makes ABLE Different

Here's the thing about ABLE: they're not just another clothing brand trying to jump on the "ethical fashion" bandwagon. Founded in 2010 by Barrett and Rachel Ward, the brand started with a simple but powerful idea in Ethiopia. They met women transitioning out of the commercial sex industry who needed real jobs, not charity. So they taught them to weave scarves. Those scarves sold like crazy—over 4,000 in just two months.

Today? ABLE has grown into a full lifestyle brand offering leather bags, jewelry, clothing, and shoes. But here's what really matters: their Nashville headquarters is staffed by 100% women, and they work with manufacturers worldwide who share their values. We're talking living wages, safe working conditions, and real opportunities for women to build better futures.

## The Product Lineup: More Than Just Good Intentions

Let's talk about what they actually sell, because ethics mean nothing if the products suck.

### Leather Bags: Built to Last

ABLE's leather bags are handcrafted, mostly in Ethiopia, from genuine distressed leather. These aren't those flimsy fashion bags that look great for a month then fall apart. The leather actually gets better with age—develops character, you know?

Popular styles include:

| Bag Type | Price Range | Key Features |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Crossbody Bags** | $80 - $150 | Perfect size for daily essentials (9"H x 10.25"W x 3"D), adjustable straps, multiple pockets |
| **Tote Bags** | $120 - $200 | Spacious enough for laptops and daily needs, sturdy construction, leather under $150 options available |
| **Wallets & Clutches** | $50 - $100 | Compact designs, quality craftsmanship, essential organization |
| **Backpacks** | $150 - $250 | Versatile for work and travel, adjustable straps, durable materials |

The Rachel Crossbody is a customer favorite with its signature knotted details. It's got that perfect balance of style and function—zipper closure, lined interior pockets, and an adjustable strap. 👉 [Shop Leather Bags](https://www.ableclothing.com)

### The Famous Merly Denim Jacket

Okay, let's talk about their crown jewel: The Merly Jacket. This is the denim jacket ABLE designed first, and honestly, they knocked it out of the park. Launched in 2017 and updated in 2022, this thing has a cult following.

**What makes it special:**
- Made from a 64% cotton, 36% lyocell blend (translation: buttery soft from day one)
- That perfect "broken-in" feel without actually having to break it in
- Fits true to size, but size up if you want to layer over sweaters
- Non-stretch denim with slim arms and dropped shoulders
- Available in multiple washes: sunbleached, original wash, clean wash, and washed black

The jacket provides jobs for over 550 women in Mexico, where the manufacturing partners clean all water used in production through their wastewater treatment plant.

**Price:** Typically around $159-$180

Customer reviews consistently rave about how this jacket just works with everything—dresses, jeans, even sweatpants. One reviewer said she ordered it and it's "easily become a favorite...perfectly worn-in like I've had it for years." 👉 [Get The Merly Jacket](https://www.ableclothing.com)

## The Real Deal on Ethical Fashion

Here's something ABLE does that most brands won't: they publish their wages. All of them. From all over the world. Why? Because 98% of fashion workers don't make a living wage. By being transparent, they're giving consumers a real choice.

The brand doesn't just talk about empowerment—they walk it. Women make up 95% of their staff. Their manufacturing partners are chosen not just for quality products, but for their wage levels and care for women in the workplace.

## Shopping Categories at a Glance

| Category | Best For | Price Points |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Leather Bags Under $150** | Budget-conscious shoppers seeking quality | $80-$150 |
| **Jewelry Under $100** | Affordable handcrafted pieces | $18-$100 |
| **Sale Section** | Bargain hunters | Up to 70% off |
| **The Edit Collection** | Timeless wardrobe essentials | Varies |
| **Bundles** | Complete looks at better prices | Package deals available |

## Is ABLE Worth It?

Short answer: Yeah, probably.

Here's my take after researching the brand and reading countless reviews: ABLE delivers on both the ethics and the quality. The Merly denim jacket isn't just hype—people genuinely love it years after purchase. The leather bags develop character instead of falling apart. The jewelry doesn't turn your skin green.

But more than that, you're buying from a company that's actually trying to change how fashion works. Not in some vague "we're eco-friendly" way, but in measurable ways that improve women's lives.

The prices are fair for ethically-made goods. When you factor in the lifetime guarantee and the quality that lasts years (not months), the cost per wear is actually pretty solid. Plus, with the frequent sales and discount codes, you can usually snag stuff at 15-40% off.

## Quick Tips for First-Time Shoppers

- **Start with the Merly Jacket or a leather bag** - These are their signature pieces for a reason
- **Size up for the jacket** if you plan to layer it
- **Sign up for emails** before you check out - you'll often get a welcome discount
- **Check the clearance section** first - quality pieces at up to 70% off
- **Use code YOURIMPACT** for 20% off your first order
- **Free shipping** kicks in at $150, so consider bundling items

## Final Thoughts

Look, I'm not going to tell you ABLE is perfect. No brand is. But they're genuinely trying to do fashion differently—and they're pulling it off pretty well.

The products are solid. The mission is real. The prices are reasonable, especially when you catch a sale. And there's something satisfying about wearing a jacket or carrying a bag that has a good story behind it.

So if you're tired of cheap fast fashion that falls apart and leaves you feeling guilty, maybe give ABLE a shot. Start with that denim jacket everyone's raving about. Or grab one of those leather bags that'll age better than most people's relationships.

Just remember to use a promo code. Because ethical fashion shouldn't mean paying full price if you don't have to.
